# ATS Resume Analyzer

> An AI-powered, full-stack Next.js application designed to optimize your resume
> for any job description by providing instant, detailed feedback.

## üìñ About The Project

In today's competitive job market, most companies use an Applicant Tracking
System (ATS) to filter resumes before they ever reach a human recruiter. This
project was built to help job seekers beat the bots.

This application allows users to upload their resume along with a specific job
description. It then leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to perform a
detailed analysis, providing an "ATS score" and actionable feedback on how to
improve the resume's content, structure, and keywords to better align with the
job requirements.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure User Authentication:** Full sign-up, sign-in, and session management
  using `better-auth`.
- **PDF Resume Uploads:** Seamless file uploads handled by Cloudinary, with
  automatic PDF-to-image conversion for display.
- **AI-Powered Feedback:** In-depth resume analysis using the **Google Gemini**
  model via the Vercel AI SDK.
- **Detailed Feedback UI:** Feedback is broken down into categories (ATS, Tone &
  Style, etc.) and presented in an interactive accordion.
- **Per-User Rate Limiting:** Protects the AI endpoint from abuse by limiting
  each user to a specific number of requests per day, implemented with Arcjet.
- **Bot Protection:** Middleware-based bot detection to secure the entire
  application.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** A modern, mobile-first UI built with Shadcn/UI
  and Tailwind CSS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Flow & Architecture

1.  **Authentication:** A user signs up or logs in. Their session is managed via
    a secure, HTTP-only cookie.
2.  **Upload:** The user fills out a form with job details and selects a PDF
    resume. On submit, the client-side code uploads the file directly to
    Cloudinary.
3.  **Record Creation:** The client then sends the job details and the new
    Cloudinary PDF URL to a POST resume endpoint. The server validates the
    request and creates a new resume record in MongoDB.
4.  **AI Analysis Trigger:** The client immediately calls the `generateFeedback`
    route with the necessary data.
5.  **Server-Side Processing:**
    - The `generateFeedback` route fetches the PDF from the Cloudinary URL.
    - It constructs a detailed prompt and sends the PDF data and prompt to the
      Google Gemini API.
    - It receives the JSON feedback, parses it, and calls a `PATCH resume/id`
      endpoint to save the feedback to the corresponding MongoDB document.
6.  **View Results:** The user is redirected to their dashboard where they can
    see all their analyzed resumes and click to view the detailed feedback page.
